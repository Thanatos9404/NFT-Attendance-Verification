- Enabling seamless event participation verification
- Empowering organizations with blockchain-based attendance solutions

## 4. Future Scope
Potential future enhancements include:
- Multi-event support with complex access controls
- Integration with academic and professional credentialing systems
- Advanced analytics for event participation
- Cross-platform verification mechanisms
- Scalable infrastructure for large-scale event management
- Dynamic NFT attributes based on participation levels
- Reputation scoring for consistent attendees
